### Sample: To train a covNet on MNIST data for digit recognition:

* Enter the input size of the image only for the first layer with each dimension seperated by a comma. 
  Here, input shape is 28,28,1.
* Enter the output shape for each layer. Here, final output shape of the layer should be 10. 
* Add all the layers required and click compile. Then click on "Train on MNIST Data Recognition". 
  This will automatically fetch the images from MNIST dataset.
* After training ends, the weights can be downloaded along with the network model.
